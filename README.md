# Open Operator

Open Operator is an open source project inspired by OpenAI's Operator feature, bringing autonomous web browsing capabilities to everyone. Built with Next.js and powered by Browserbase's web automation technology, it enables AI agents to interact with web interfaces naturally and effectively.

## Features

- 🌐 Autonomous web browsing and interaction
- 🤖 Natural language interface for web navigation
- 🔄 Real-time browser state synchronization
- 🛠️ Extensible architecture for custom actions
- 📱 Responsive design for all devices
- 🎭 Reliable browser automation with Stagehand
- 🔍 Precise DOM understanding and manipulation

## Getting Started

First, install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
# or
pnpm install
```

Then, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see Open Operator in action.

## How It Works

Open Operator uses a combination of AI models and advanced browser automation to enable natural web interactions:

1. **Understanding Intent**: Natural language processing to understand user intentions
2. **Browser Automation**: Leverages Browserbase's technology for reliable web interaction
3. **DOM Management**: Uses Stagehand for precise DOM traversal and manipulation
4. **Action Execution**: Translates intentions into precise browser actions
5. **Real-time Feedback**: Provides immediate visual and textual feedback

The system combines these technologies to:
- Parse and understand natural language commands
- Navigate and interact with web interfaces
- Execute complex sequences of actions
- Provide real-time feedback and results

### Key Technologies

- **Browserbase**: Powers the core browser automation and interaction capabilities
- **Stagehand**: Handles precise DOM manipulation and state management
- **Next.js**: Provides the modern web framework foundation
- **AI Models**: Enable natural language understanding and decision making
